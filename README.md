# Description of Parameters
## Step size: 0.13
We chose a step size that is fast enough to see the direction of the wind, but not too fast that you cannot follow the path of the wind. We tried values starting at 0.05 to 3. Any speed above 1.5 seemed to be too fast, but a range of speeds from 1 to 1.5 is adequate in perceiving the path of the wind.

## Number of particles: 2800
The number of particles is important in perceiving the path of the wind. Any number below 2000 was too little to see how wind travelled, but any number above 3000 was too many points, in which the display space was too cluttered. A display space that is too cluttered makes it difficult to follow the pattern because of the lack of space between the points. When the number of particles is too small, the points are too spread out that you cannot perceive the path. 

## Lifetime: 200
We chose a lifetime of 200 because numbers below or above this value made the particles stay too long on the screen or die too fast to see the wind pattern. A range between 180 and 220 is adequate for this project, but we think 200 is a good medium for the lifetime for each point. 

# Wizardly Work
We did not work on any extra features or elements to this project.
